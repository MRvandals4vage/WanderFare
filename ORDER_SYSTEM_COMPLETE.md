# WanderFare Order System - Complete Implementation

**Date:** October 12, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Fully Functional

## Overview

Implemented a complete end-to-end ordering system for customers to browse vendors, view menus, place orders, and track their purchase history.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Vendor Menu Page** (`vendor-menu-page.tsx`)
A comprehensive menu browsing and ordering interface with:

**Features:**
- View vendor details (name, description, ratings, hours, delivery fee)
- Browse all menu items with search and category filtering
- Add items to cart with quantity controls
- Real-time cart total calculation (subtotal + delivery fee)
- Minimum order validation
- Delivery address and special instructions input
- Place order functionality with backend integration

**User Experience:**
- Responsive grid layout for menu items
- Sticky cart sidebar for easy checkout
- Visual feedback for dietary preferences (Vegetarian, Vegan, Gluten-Free)
- Category-based filtering
- Search functionality across item names and descriptions
- Loading states and error handling

### 2. **Updated Vendors Page**
Modified to support navigation to menu pages:
- "View Menu" button now navigates to vendor-specific menu
- Passes vendor ID to menu page
- Maintains state across navigation

### 3. **Backend Integration**

#### Order Creation Flow:
```
Customer → Frontend → POST /api/orders → Backend → Database
```

**Request Format:**
```json
{
  "vendorId": 5,
  "deliveryAddress": "123 Main St, Apt 4B",
  "specialInstructions": "Ring doorbell twice",
  "orderItems": [
    { "menuItemId": 10, "quantity": 2 },
    { "menuItemId": 15, "quantity": 1 }
  ]
}
```

**Backend Processing:**
1. Validates customer authentication (JWT)
2. Extracts customer ID from token
3. Validates vendor exists and is active
4. Validates menu items exist and are available
5. Calculates order total
6. Creates order record with status "PENDING"
7. Creates order_items records
8. Returns complete order details

**Database Updates:**
- `orders` table: New order record created
- `order_items` table: Line items for each menu item
- Customer purchase history automatically updated
- Vendor order queue automatically updated

### 4. **Purchase History Integration**

Orders are automatically visible in:
- **Customer History Page** (`/orders/customer/my-orders`)
  - Shows all orders placed by the customer
  - Displays order status, items, total amount
  - Allows reordering

- **Vendor Orders Page** (`/orders/vendor/my-orders`)
  - Shows all orders for the vendor
  - Allows status updates
  - Tracks revenue

## API Endpoints Used

### Customer Endpoints
- `GET /api/vendors/browse` - List all approved vendors
- `GET /api/vendors/{id}` - Get vendor details
- `GET /api/vendors/menu/vendor/{vendorId}` - Get vendor menu
- `POST /api/orders` - Create new order (requires CUSTOMER role)
- `GET /api/orders/customer/my-orders` - Get customer order history

### Vendor Endpoints
- `GET /api/orders/vendor/my-orders` - Get vendor orders
- `PATCH /api/orders/{orderId}/status` - Update order status

## Data Flow

### Order Placement:
```
1. Customer browses vendors → GET /vendors/browse
2. Customer clicks "View Menu" → Navigate to vendor-menu page
3. Customer adds items to cart → Local state management
4. Customer enters delivery address
5. Customer clicks "Place Order" → POST /orders
6. Backend creates order → Database insert
7. Success message → Redirect to history page
8. Order appears in customer history
9. Order appears in vendor's order queue
```

### Inventory Management:
- Menu items have `isAvailable` flag
- Only available items can be added to cart
- Vendors can toggle availability in their profile
- Real-time updates reflected in customer view

## Testing

    "deliveryAddress": "123 Main St",
    "orderItems": [
      {"menuItemId": 1, "quantity": 2}
    ]
